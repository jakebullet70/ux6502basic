# Handoff: project state, engine internals, CONST with a pre-pass

Status on 2026-10-07, at commit 6dd0bf6. This note is for a developer (or a new session) who
picks up the work. It explains how the interpreter works inside, where the project stands, and a
design for `CONST` that adds a second pass over the program before `RUN` starts it. Check
`git log` and `TODO.md` first; they may be newer than this note.

## 1. Where the project stands

ux6502Basic is Microsoft BASIC for the NMOS 6502, built with ca65. `src/` is a fork of
mist64/msbasic. One source tree builds three targets:

| Target | Purpose | Check |
|---|---|---|
| `cbmbasic1`, `cbmbasic2` | Original Commodore ROMs | `make verify` must match the ROM dumps byte for byte |
| `sim` | Our build for sim65, headless | `make test` (31 tests) |

The new hardware and its Unix-style kernal do not exist as a target yet. The `sim` target stands
in for them. Everything the kernal must supply is a small set of target primitives (`K_OPEN`,
`K_CLOSE`, `K_READ`, `K_WRITE`, `K_JIFFY`, `K_VPEEK`, `K_VPOKE`, `K_SCREEN`), so the port means
writing those, not changing the interpreter.

Size of the sim image: 12056 bytes at $C000-$EF17, 4072 bytes free below $FF00. 99 tokens are in
use ($80-$E2).

Done, in the sim build only (each behind a `CONFIG_` switch in `src/defines_sim.s`):

- Files through Unix-style handles: `OPEN`, `CLOSE`, `PRINT#`, `INPUT#`, `GET#`, `CMD`, `ST`.
- Block `IF`/`ELSE`/`END IF`, `DO`/`LOOP`/`EXIT`/`CONTINUE`.
- Labels: `100 name:`, `GOTO name`, `GOSUB name`, `RUN name`, `RESTORE name`, names in `ON`.
- Functions and operators: `INSTR`, `HEX$`, `BIN$`, `UCASE$`, `LCASE$`, `RPT$`, `MOD`, `XOR`,
  `SHL`, `SHR`, `DEEK`/`DOKE`, `PI`, `$FF` and `%1010` literals, `POS(1)`.
- Screen: `TEXTAT`, `CLS`, `LOCATE`, `COLOR` (ANSI codes), `SCREEN`, `VPEEK`/`VPOKE` (stubs).
- `PAUSE n`.
- Speed: GOTO target cache, simple-variable cache, faster number input (`CONFIG_FAST_FIN`).
- Removed to save bytes: `LET`, `SPC(`, the startup prompts.
- Long names: no keyword search inside a name (`CONFIG_NAME_NOCRUNCH`), so `TOTAL` is a name.

Next in `TODO.md`, in order: `'` as `REM`; the `FINDATA` bug (`10 X=1: DATA 5` is missed); maybe
drop `TAB(`. After that: SUB and FUNCTION (TODO 2, `docs/sub-function.md`), integer math
(TODO 3), inline assembly (TODO 4, `docs/inline-asm.md`), a user reference (TODO 5).

Open decisions are listed in `docs/inline-asm.md` and `docs/sub-function.md`. The far-memory
`PEEK`/`POKE` idea is deferred; do not build it yet.

## 2. How the engine works

### Memory map (sim)

```
$0000-$00FF  zero page: interpreter state, CHRGET routine, our extras at $F0-$F9
$0100-$01FF  6502 stack: FOR, GOSUB and DO frames, expression temporaries
$0200-$024F  input buffer (INPUTBUFFER, 80 characters, LINE_MAX)
$0400        a zero byte, then the program text from $0401 (TXTTAB)
   ...       program text, ends with a link of $0000
VARTAB       simple variables, 7 bytes each
ARYTAB       arrays
STREND       end of arrays; free space starts here
   ...       free space
FRETOP       string heap grows down from MEMSIZ
MEMSIZ       top of BASIC RAM ($C000, found by the cold-start scan, which stops at SIM_RAMTOP)
$C000-$EF17  BASIC ROM image; the IORAM segment (file table, caches) is inside it, writable
             only because sim65 has RAM there. The new hardware needs that segment in real RAM.
```

`CHKMEM` and `GETSPA` keep STREND below FRETOP. When they meet, the string garbage collector
(`GARBAG`, `string.s`) runs; if that does not help, the result is `?OUT OF MEMORY`.

### Program lines

A stored line is: 2-byte link to the next line, 2-byte line number, tokenized text, a zero byte.
A link of zero ends the program. Keywords are one byte, $80 and up. With
`CONFIG_NAME_NOCRUNCH`, a letter right after a letter is stored as text, so long names and
label names are plain ASCII in the line.

- `PARSE_INPUT_LINE` (`program.s`) tokenizes the typed line in place in the input buffer.
  It walks the keyword table with `KW_PTR` (`CONFIG_KW16`), so the table may pass 256 bytes.
  Lowercase keywords and names are folded; strings, `REM` and `DATA` keep their case.
- `NUMBERED_LINE` / `PUT_NEW_LINE` insert or replace the line, then `FIX_LINKS` rebuilds the
  link chain and `SETPTRS` sets VARTAB behind the program and clears everything. So any edit
  loses all variables, as in every Microsoft BASIC.

### CHRGET

`CHRGET` is a small routine copied into zero page at cold start. It holds `TXTPTR` inside its own
`LDA` instruction (self-modifying code). `JSR CHRGET` steps to the next non-space byte and sets
flags: carry clear for a digit, Z set for end of statement (`:` or zero). `CHRGOT` reads the
current byte again. Every parser in the interpreter reads text through these two.

### Statement loop

`NEWSTT` (`flow1.s`) is the main loop:

1. Call `ISCNTC` (break key).
2. At a zero byte, step to the next line: read the link (zero means end of program), store the
   line number in `CURLIN`, move `TXTPTR`. In direct mode `CURLIN+1` is $FF.
3. `CHRGET`, then `EXECUTE_STATEMENT`.

`EXECUTE_STATEMENT` subtracts $80 from a token and jumps through `TOKEN_ADDRESS_TABLE` with the
RTS trick (push address-1, `JMP CHRGET`, the `RTS` in CHRGET lands in the handler with the next
byte loaded). A byte below $80 is an assignment; with `CONFIG_LABELS` it first goes to
`LABEL_SKIP`, which skips a `name:` label at a line start.

`RUN` with no argument calls `SETPTRS` (TXTPTR to the start of the program, then `CLEARC`) and
returns into `NEWSTT`. `RUN n` or `RUN name` calls `CLEARC` and then `GOTO`.

`CLEARC` (`program.s`) empties the GOTO and variable caches, sets FRETOP = MEMSIZ, closes all
files, sets ARYTAB = STREND = VARTAB (so all variables are gone), resets `DATA`, and resets the
6502 stack. It runs on NEW, RUN, CLR and every program line entry.

### Expressions

`FRMEVL` (`eval.s`) is a precedence parser. The result is in `FAC`, a 5-byte float plus sign;
`ARG` is the second operand. `VALTYP` says string ($FF) or number. Strings are 3-byte
descriptors (length, address); temporary descriptors sit on a small stack at `TEMPST`, with
`TEMPPT` as its pointer. All arithmetic is floating point; `%` variables are converted on every
access (TODO 3 would change that).

### Variables

`PTRGET` (`var.s`) reads a name and returns the address of its value in `VARPNT` (also A/Y).
Only the first 2 characters count; the rest are skipped. The type goes into bit 7 of the 2 name
bytes: `A$` sets bit 7 of the second byte, `A%` sets both. A simple variable is 7 bytes: 2 name
bytes and 5 value bytes (a float, an integer in 2 bytes, or a string descriptor in 3).

Search: `VC_FIND` (`varcache.s`) looks the name up in a 64-entry direct-mapped cache. On a miss,
PTRGET searches from VARTAB to ARYTAB, and makes a new entry at ARYTAB if the name is not found,
moving all arrays up 7 bytes. A simple variable never moves once it exists, which is why the
cache stays valid until `CLEARC`.

Stores go through `LET` (`misc1.s`, also used by `FOR`) and `PROCESS_INPUT_ITEM` (`input.s`,
used by `INPUT`, `READ` and `GET`). Both call PTRGET and save the address in `FORPNT`. `DEF FN`
also writes its parameter variable for the length of the call.

### GOTO, labels and caches

- `GOTO n` (`flow2.s`) searches the line chain for line n, from the current line when n is
  higher, else from the start.
- `GOTO_CACHED` (`gotocache.s`): the key is the text address of the line number after `GOTO`;
  the value is the target `TXTPTR`. 64 entries, direct-mapped. Direct-mode lines are not cached.
- `LABEL_FIND` (`labels.s`) walks every line from TXTTAB and compares the name with the text
  after the line number, up to `:`. All characters of a label count. The result is cached the
  same way as a line number, so the walk runs only once per call site.

### Blocks and loops

- `FOR` pushes an 18-byte frame (variable address, step, limit, line, text pointer). `GOSUB`
  pushes 5 bytes plus the return address. `DO` pushes a 5-byte frame like `GOSUB`. All on the
  256-byte 6502 stack; `STACK_TOP` is $FA.
- Block `IF` pushes nothing: a false condition scans forward over the tokenized text to the
  matching `ELSE` or `END IF`, counting nesting (`block.s`, state in `BLK_DEPTH`, `BLK_LAST`,
  `BLK_MODE`). `EXIT` and `CONTINUE` scan the same way.

### I/O

The interpreter reaches the console and files only through `IO_CHKIN`, `IO_CHKOUT`, `IO_CLRCH`,
`IO_CHRIN`, `IO_CLALL`, `MONCOUT`, `MONRDKEY` and `ISCNTC`. `handle_io.s` maps logical file
numbers to Unix-style handles and calls the `K_` primitives. In the sim those are sim65
paravirtual calls at $FFF4-$FFF9. Handle 0 is stdin, 1 is stdout.

### Errors

`ERROR` (`error.s`) takes an error number in X, prints `?message ERROR`, adds `IN line` when
`CURLIN` is a program line, resets the stack and returns to the prompt. Each new message costs
its text plus a table entry, so reuse an existing message where the meaning fits.

### Build and test

Run `make all`, `make test` and `make verify` in Git Bash. Tests type `tests/NAME.bas` into the
sim and compare the output with `tests/NAME.out`. Every `src/` change gets a test, an entry in
`docs/changes.md` in the same commit, and a size note in `docs/keywords.md` when a keyword
changes. Changes that are not for `cbmbasic1`/`cbmbasic2` go behind `.ifdef`.

## 3. CONST with a pre-pass

### What the pre-pass is

Today `RUN` starts executing at once, and everything is found lazily: a label on its first
`GOTO`, a variable on its first use. The pre-pass is a second pass over the program text that
runs before the first statement executes. It walks the line chain once and handles the lines
that declare something. Then `RUN` goes on as now.

The pre-pass looks only at the start of each line, behind the line number, so it is fast: it
follows the links and reads one or two bytes per line. Lines that declare nothing are skipped.

```
RUN
 └─ SETPTRS / CLEARC          (as now: clear variables, caches, stack)
 └─ PREPASS                   (new)
     for each line:
       CURLIN = line number   (so errors print "IN line")
       first byte = CONST?    → evaluate and create the constants
       (later) SUB / FUNCTION → record the entry address
       (later) name:          → check for duplicate labels
     CONSTEND = ARYTAB        (end of the constants)
 └─ NEWSTT                    (as now)
```

### What CONST does

Syntax: `CONST name = expression [, name = expression ...]`, alone at the start of a line.

- In the pre-pass, each `name = expression` is handed to the normal `LET` code. LET calls
  PTRGET, which creates the variable at the start of the variable table, because the pre-pass
  runs right after `CLEARC` when the table is empty. The expression may use numbers, strings,
  `PI`, functions and earlier constants.
- After the pre-pass, the constants are the first entries from VARTAB up to a new pointer,
  `CONSTEND`.
- `CLEARC` sets ARYTAB and STREND to `CONSTEND` instead of VARTAB. So `CLR` keeps the
  constants, and normal variables are made above them.
- At run time, a `CONST` line does nothing: its token jumps to the `DATA` handler, which skips
  to the end of the statement.
- A store into a constant is an error. The check sits where LET and PROCESS_INPUT_ITEM save the
  address in `FORPNT`: if the address is below `CONSTEND` and the pre-pass is not running,
  stop with an error. One shared routine (store FORPNT, compare) replaces the two `STA`/`STY`
  pairs, so the check costs little. `FOR` on a constant fails through LET.
- Reads need no change. A constant is found like any variable, and the variable cache makes it
  as fast as a normal variable.
- A string constant points into the program text, as a string literal in an assignment already
  does, so it takes no heap space.

This solves the main problem in `TODO.md`, "all CONSTs must run before any other variable is
created": the pre-pass makes that true by construction, wherever the CONST lines are in the
program.

### What stays the same as a variable

Only the first 2 characters of a name count. `CONST MAXSPEED=5` and `CONST MAXSIZE=9` are the
same constant, and a variable `MA` reads `MAXSPEED`. Two ways to deal with that:

1. Accept it, and let the pre-pass report a second CONST with the same 2-character name as an
   error. An assignment to `MA` elsewhere then fails with the constant error, which shows the
   clash. This is the cheap form.
2. Give constants full names through their own table, searched with all characters, like
   labels. The variable cache cannot help here (its key is the 2-byte name), so a lookup would
   need a cache keyed on the text address, like the GOTO cache. This is the expensive form, and
   it shares its table with labels, SUB names and assembler labels (TODO 4).

Recommendation: build form 1 now; keep form 2 for when SUB and the assembler need a full-name
symbol table anyway.

### Cases to handle

- **GOTO in direct mode.** `GOTO 100` typed at the prompt starts the program without `RUN`, so
  the pre-pass does not run and the constants do not exist. Options: run the pre-pass from the
  direct-mode branch of `GOTO_CACHED` too (it already tests for direct mode), or use a flag that
  line entry and `NEW` set and the pre-pass clears, and run the pre-pass when the flag is set.
- **CONT.** Line entry already makes `CONT` impossible, so the constants are always current.
- **A normal variable in a CONST expression.** `CONST B=A*2` with no constant `A` would create
  `A` during the pre-pass, so `A` becomes read-only. Either accept and document it, or let
  PTRGET give an error for a new name while the pre-pass runs (a few bytes more).
- **CONST not at a line start.** `10 X=1: CONST Y=2` is not seen by the pre-pass, and at run
  time the line does nothing. Either document it or make the run-time handler give an error when
  the constant does not exist.
- **DEF FN parameter.** `DEF FN F(C)` with a constant `C` writes `C` during the call. Rare;
  document it or check it.
- **Array constants.** Not planned. `DIM` stays the way to make arrays.

### Cost estimate

Guesses until code exists:

| Part | Bytes |
|---|---|
| `CONST` keyword entry and token | 6-8 |
| Pre-pass line walk (can share code with `LABEL_FIND`) | 30-40 |
| CONST in the pre-pass (loop over `LET`, commas) | 10-15 |
| `CONSTEND` pointer, set in pre-pass, used by `CLEARC` | 8-10 |
| Read-only check (shared FORPNT routine) | 12-18 |
| Direct-mode GOTO or dirty flag | 8-12 |
| New error message, if one is added | 12-16 |
| **Total** | **about 85-120** |

`CONSTEND` needs 2 bytes of RAM; zero page $FA-$FF is free in the sim (check `defines_sim.s`).

### What else the pre-pass can do later

Once the walk exists, more declarations can use it for a few bytes each:

- **SUB and FUNCTION** (TODO 2): record each `SUB name` address in the pre-pass, so the first
  `CALL` does not scan. The pre-pass can also check that every `SUB` has an `END SUB`.
- **Labels**: report a duplicate label at `RUN` instead of silently using the first one.
- **Block checks**: report an `IF ... THEN` block with no `END IF`, or a `DO` with no `LOOP`, at
  `RUN` instead of when the scan runs off the end.
- **Inline assembly** (TODO 4): the pre-pass could run the assembler's first pass, so forward
  labels are known and the program no longer needs the `FOR P=0 TO 1` loop. This would reverse
  the decision that two passes are not automatic, so ask first.

### Questions for the user

1. Which error for a store into a constant: a new message (for example `?CONST ERROR`, about
   14 bytes) or an existing one?
2. Form 1 (2-character names, cheap) now, and full names later?
3. Direct-mode `GOTO`: run the pre-pass there, use a dirty flag, or document it?
4. Should the pre-pass also take over the SUB lookup and the assembler's first pass when those
   are built?
5. Where in the TODO order: before or after `'` as REM and the FINDATA bug?

### Ways to save bytes

- Reuse the `DATA` handler for the run-time CONST (no new handler).
- Reuse `LET` for the pre-pass evaluation (no new parser).
- One shared routine for the read-only check at both store points.
- Share the line walk with `LABEL_FIND`.
- Reuse an existing error message.
- Infer BYTE or WORD from the value in the assembler (see `docs/inline-asm.md`), so typed
  `CONST BYTE` keywords are never needed.
